# Course Data Scraping

Lions Den is an old system, and without direct access to the database from which it draws its information, our advising app will not be able to easily retrieve the course data.  As such, we'll want to create a bot that gets the relevant course data and stores all of it in a file in a format that's easily usable by our app.  The format we'll be using is called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).  A bot that does this is called a web scraper.  To do this, we'll need to have it simulate the steps that a person would do: make a course search for all courses and manually retrieve the data for each course one page at a time.  The bot of course will accomplish this task a little differently than we would as it will not be using a mouse and a keyboard to navigate through the results and it will be working with source code rather than the output we see on the screen.  This means we will need to look "under the hood" to see the form data that's being sent and the HTML that's used for displaying the course information to determine how we program the bot.  

## Request/Response Observation
+ To determine the necessary request data (header and body), open up the Developer console first, make a search for courses at https://lionsden.molloy.edu/ICS/Course_Search/Course_Search.jnz?portlet=Course_Schedules&screen=Advanced+Course+Search&screenType=next and check the Network tab:

+ The relevant request is under `Course_Search.jnz?portlet=Course_Schedules&screen=Advanced+Course+Search&screenType=next`.
+ Trial and error by removing and modifying request data can tell you what's essential for it to succeed.  Using a tool such as Burp Suite Proxy allows you to modify and repeat the requests so you can see those that provide the desired response data, which in this case is the list of courses.  We'll spare you from this tedious work, and let you know what's needed.
